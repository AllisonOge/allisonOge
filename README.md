# ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ogechukwu.

Currently, I'm a MSc student at University of Calgary WAVES Lab for machine learning and wireless communication systems. I am advised by [Dr. Hatem Abou-Zeid](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/hatem-abou-zeid).

My latest focus is building generalizable models with self-supervised learning for a variety of wireless communication tasks at the front-end or PHY layer.

- [RadioSSL](https://github.com/AllisonOge/RadioSSL) builds generalizable model for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks

Previously, I worked on fully supervised models on classification and regression tasks at [Qoherent Inc.](https://qoherent.ai/).

- [qIQ2Seq_forecast](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qIQ2Seq_forecast) takes history of IQ samples and predicts a 2ms window in the future
- [qRadioMoCo](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qRadioMoCo) attempts to learns two in distribution tasks with self-supervised learning using MoCo framework
- [qSeptroDetect](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qSpectroDetect) is a signal localization and classification model on both narrow and wideband spectrum given IQ samples
